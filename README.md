**Project name:** Disc Golf Equipment Price Comparator

**Summary (singular purpose):** The purpose of the project is to provide a central location for displaying the prices of different disc golf equipment based on data from manufacturers and resellers.

**Detailed description:**

Disc golf, also called frisbee golf, is a rapidly growing sport in the United States, Finland, and Estonia. Here is some insight into the sport:

Given the growth in the sport, there are currently multiple disc golf equipment manufacturers, such as Discmania, Innova, Dynamic Discs, Latitude 64, and many others, as well as an even wider variety of disc golf equipment resellers. The numerous options can often make it difficult to find the best market deals. Therefore, the idea behind my course project is to compile shop data from both resellers and manufacturers, and aggregate the data into a central location. As mentioned, this aims to help identify the most competitively priced products in the market and even discover unique editions of equipment that are sold exclusively in certain stores. Some of the manufacturer and reseller sites included are listed below, primarily focusing on a scope local to the Nordics and Baltics:

* par3.lv
* discsporteurope.com
* powergrip.fi
* diskiundiskicesis.lv
* latitude64.com
* kiekkokingi.fi

This will enables site visitors to easily search, filter, and compare products between the resellers to make the best choice.
